## Files
* CODEBOOK.md - a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that were performed to clean up the data
* run_analysis.R - performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s definition:
  * Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  * Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  * Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  * Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  * From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
* TidyData.txt - exported data sample after performing the above steps
